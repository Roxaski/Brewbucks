## Welcome to Brewbucks

This webpage was create for everyone's favourite Barista. As a huge Animal Crossing fan, and a big lover of Brewster. I really wanted to create something that he would be proud of. You can find everything, from opening times to a menu and some information about entertainment, which OG Animal Crossing fans will likely remember from the days when the incredible K.K Slider would perform at Brewster's cozy little café.

## Feedback

If anyone has any feedback i would greatly appreciate it, as i'm currently learning web development and if anybody has any constructive notes for me to improve upon, that would be great! For anyone that checks it out i hope you enjoyed browsing it as much as i enjoyed building it.
