                    <p>Welcome to Brewbucks our cozy little café, me and my wife decided to open this cozy little place, which we call our home away from home. We agreed to open it at the tail end of 2005. We thought since it's a wild world out there, we would open a lovely cozy place to serve our delicious food and drinks.</p>

                    <p>We have made some renovations throughout the years, our goal was always keep the cozy café vibe. We felt like we want anyone who came in to feel right at home when they would visit us here at Brewbucks.</p>

                    <p>We cater for everyone, offering drinks that cater to both the tea and coffee lovers, and serving a variety of food that is both vegeterian and vegan friendly.</p>
