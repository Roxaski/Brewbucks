                    <p>Welcome to Brewbucks our cozy little café, me and my wife decided to open this cozy little place, we call it our home away from home. It opened it up at the tail end of 2005, i thought it's a wild world out there so why not open a cozy place to serve some delicious coffee and drinks.</p>
                    <p>We have many a few renovations throughtout the years, but we always decided to keep our cozy café vibe throughout, we want anyone who comes in to feel right at home when they come visit us here at Brewbucks.</p>
                    <p>We cater for pretty much everyone, by offering drinks that cater to both the tea and coffee lovers, as well as having a variety of food that are vegan and vegeterian friendly.</p>
